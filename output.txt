---
## Situation
Briefly describe the current business context and objectives for this EDG project (1–2 sentences). Reference factual anchors such as revenue scale, team size, ops footprint, or systems if available. Include citations for any numbers. 

## Complication
Summarise the core pain points that justify external consultancy (process gaps, capability gaps, compliance/productivity issues, data fragmentation, change management, etc.). Keep concise and grounded in the client’s materials.

## Question
State the key question this engagement must answer (e.g., “How do we redesign process X and implement solution Y to achieve Z outcomes within N months?”). Keep this as one clear question.

## Answer (Scope of Work)
Outline **what the consultants will do** and **what the client will get**.

### 1) Approach & Methodology
- Brief description of the approach (diagnose → design → pilot → implement → stabilise), adapted to the project’s context.
- Name any frameworks, toolkits, or benchmarks only if they appear in evidence.
- Call out data collection methods (interviews, shadowing, system logs) if present in evidence.

### 2) Phased Workplan & Deliverables
Break down the project into phases. For each phase, include **objective, activities, deliverables, man-days**. Use only activities/deliverables present in the consultant’s proposal or client brief.

**Phase 1 — Discovery / Diagnosis**
- Objective: …
- Activities: …
- Deliverables: …
- Estimated man-days: … [source:vendor_proposal or consultant_proposal]

**Phase 2 — Design**
- Objective: …
- Activities: …
- Deliverables: …
- Estimated man-days: … [source:vendor_proposal]

**Phase 3 — Implementation / Pilot**
- Objective: …
- Activities: …
- Deliverables: …
- Estimated man-days: … [source:vendor_proposal]

**Phase 4 — Stabilisation / Handover**
- Objective: …
- Activities: …
- Deliverables: SOPs, training, handover notes, KPIs baseline, etc. (only if stated in evidence)
- Estimated man-days: … [source:vendor_proposal]

> If the proposal defines different or fewer phases, mirror those exactly and keep the same structure.

### 3) Team & Credentials
- List named consultants and roles only if present in evidence.  
  Include **man-day rate breakdown** (e.g., Partner, Principal, Consultant) if stated.  
  - Example: Partner S$X/day; Consultant S$Y/day. [source:fee_breakdown]
- For projects where **management consultants** are engaged, include:
  - Summary of **scope of work** drawn from the consultants’ proposal. [source:consultant_proposal]
  - **Man-day rate breakdown** for each grade. [source:fee_breakdown]
  - **CV highlights** (relevant projects, years experience) for key individuals, if provided. [source:consultant_cvs]
  - **TR 43 or SS 680 certification** details for each consultant; mention certificate IDs or scans if present. [source:consultant_certifications]

### 4) Fee Breakdown (by phase and role)
Provide a transparent breakdown strictly from the proposal:
- **Per phase**: activities covered, man-days, rate(s), **subtotal**.  
- **By role/grade**: rate and allocated man-days.  
- **Total professional fees** and any **out-of-pocket expenses** if stated.  
All figures must appear in evidence; do **not** estimate.  
Use a short bullet/table-like structure in text, e.g.:

- Phase 1: Discovery — X man-days × S$R/day = **S$…**. [source:fee_breakdown]  
- Phase 2: Design — …  
- Total Professional Fees: **S$…**. [source:fee_breakdown]

### 5) Client Responsibilities & Assumptions
List any assumptions or prerequisites explicitly mentioned in the proposal (e.g., timely access to data/stakeholders, test environment availability, decision cadence, travel policy). [source:consultant_proposal]

### 6) Timeline & Milestones
Summarise duration and key milestones per phase (e.g., “Week 1–3 Discovery; Week 4 Design workshops; Week 5–8 Pilot”). Only include dates/durations present in evidence. [source:project_timeline]

### 7) Governance & Reporting
- Steering or working committee structure, meeting cadence, and artefacts (status reports, RAID logs) **if** stated. [source:consultant_proposal]
- Escalation path and acceptance checkpoints per phase if available.

### 8) Risks & Mitigations
List the **top 3–5 engagement risks** that are mentioned or clearly implied in evidence (e.g., data availability, stakeholder bandwidth, integration complexity), each with a mitigation drawn from the proposal/plan. Keep crisp and factual.

### 9) Expected Outcomes & KPIs
Summarise the outcomes the consultancy will enable (process cycle-time reduction, error-rate reduction, adoption targets) **only if** such outcomes/KPIs are present in evidence. If quantitative targets exist, cite them. [source:benefits_case or vendor_proposal]

---
**Output rules (strict)**
- Use concise headings and bullet lists; avoid marketing fluff.
- Do **not** fabricate deliverables, rates, man-days, or certifications.
- Every number must have a citation like [source:fee_breakdown] or [source:consultant_proposal].
- Prefer client/consultant wording where available; otherwise summarise neutrally.

Keep concise and grounded in the client’s materials.\n\n## Question\nState the key question this engagement must answer (e.g., “How do we redesign process X and implement solution Y to achieve Z outcomes within N months?”).

[source:consultant_proposal]\n\n### 6) Timeline & Milestones\nSummarise duration and key milestones per phase (e.g., “Week 1–3 Discovery; Week 4 Design workshops; Week 5–8 Pilot”). Only include dates/durations present in evidence. [source:project_timeline]\n\n### 7) Governance & Reporting\n- Steering or working committee structure, meeting cadence, and artefacts (status reports, RAID logs) **if** stated. [source:consultant_proposal]\n- Escalation path and acceptance checkpoints per phase if available.\n\n### 8) Risks & Mitigations\nList the **top 3–5 engagement risks** that are mentioned or clearly implied in evidence (e.g., data availability, stakeholder bandwidth, integration complexity), each with a mitigation drawn from the proposal/plan. Keep crisp and factual.\n\n### 9) Expected Outcomes & KPIs\nSummarise the outcomes the consultancy will enable (process cycle-time reduction, error-rate reduction, adoption targets) **only if** such outcomes/KPIs are present in evidence. If quantitative targets exist, cite them. [source:benefits_case or vendor_proposal]\n\n---\n**Output rules (strict)**\n- Use concise headings and bullet lists; avoid marketing fluff.\n- Do **not** fabricate deliverables, rates, man-days, or certifications.\n- Every number must have a citation like [source:fee_breakdown] or [source:consultant_proposal].\n- Prefer client/consultant wording where available; otherwise summarise neutrally.",
